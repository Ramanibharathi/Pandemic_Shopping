register their shops with the exact location and other details. The customers can look for
nearby shops and can send their requirements to that store.This works on a first come
first serve basis, So that the customers who had ordered earlierwill be at the top of the
shopkeeper’s orders list.<br>

The products are packed and the notification is sent to the customer’s account.
Notification includes time for the customer to reach the store to receive the package
along with the total cost and unavailable products in their requirements.
The customer can reach the shop and complete the payment according to his
convenience and collect the package.</p>
